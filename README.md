# mancala web implementation

A mancala web implementation by Soufiane Abba. Build with Java Spring boot and H2 database for the backend. Vanilla html, css and js for the frontend. 

The game currently only has the option to play online with someone else randomly.




## Demo

Made possible with heroku deployment.
The game is playable at the following url:
https://mancala-demo.herokuapp.com/

The game uses websockets to connect 2 players with each other. 
To test it out I suggest to open the url in 2 tabs so that you can play against yourself.
